# MavenWithLombok

This project demonstrates the usage of Maven in Java for managing dependencies and building projects.

## Overview

In this project, we use Maven, a popular build automation tool for Java projects,
to manage dependencies and build our project. Maven simplifies project configuration,
dependency management, and project building by providing a uniform build system and a consistent project structure.

## Dependencies

In this project I created a user class using a lombok Dependency in the pom.xml file.
